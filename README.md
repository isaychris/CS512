In this course we covered the concept of Data Mining using the data mining models specially the models related to regression. 

A1 = Matrix Manipulation Part 1
A2 = Matrix Manipulation Part 2
A3 = Genetic Algorithm (GA)  
A4 = Differnential Evolution (DE)  
A5 = Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO)  
A6 = DE-BPSO
